/**
 * @class KinematicsModel
 * @brief This class provides methods regarding the kinematics of the 4-DOF PhantomX pincher robot arm.
 * 
 * This class allows the user to e.g. simulate end effector poses for varying joint states, inverse kinematics
 * and differential kinematics. It is currently based on the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters of the robot.
 * Unfortunately, we cannot apply DH parameters since the turtlebot_arm package does not define the coordinate systems
 * in the robot URDF according to the convention. E.g. all rotations are around the y-axis.
 * 
 * If you want to simulate the kinematics model in Matlab using Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox, use the following model:
 * @code
 *      l1 = Link('revolute','d',0.065,'a',0,'alpha',-pi/2);
 *      l2 = Link('revolute','d',0,'a',0.1015,'alpha',0,'offset',-pi/2);
 *      l3 = Link('revolute','d',0,'a',0.1015,'alpha',0);
 *      l4 = Link('revolute','d',0,'a',0.0880,'alpha',0);
 *      arm = SerialLink([l1,l2,l3,l4]);
 *      arm.tool = troty(-pi/2) * trotx(pi) * trotz(-pi/2);
 * @endcode
 * But only the relation between the arm_base_link and gripper frame are identically. The individual joint 
 * coordinate systems differ from each other (since the robotics toolbox relies on DH paramters)
 * 
 * @todo Make templated for arbitrary robots
 * @todo Extract trasnformations from URDF/Mesh files of the robot.
 * @remarks We restrict ourselves to revolute joints only.

   * The underlying inverse kinematics tries to set the translation and the pitch angle of the desired pose.
